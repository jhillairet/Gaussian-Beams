This code has been made in 2004-2007 in the frame of my PhD research on gaussian beams diffraction. 
The code here can evaluate the diffraction of an incident gaussian beam on a rectangular PEC plate.
It is given "as it was', just in case it could serve someone one day...

In order to run the example codes, add the 'lib' directory and its subdirectories to the matlab path before.
